**Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project develops a **Heart Disease Prediction System** using machine learning to analyze patient data and assess the risk of heart disease. The system processes key health factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits to detect patterns associated with heart conditions.  

The project begins with **data preprocessing**, ensuring clean and relevant data for accurate predictions. Machine learning models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, are trained on patient records to identify risk factors and predict the likelihood of heart disease.  

By providing **real-time risk assessments**, this system helps in early detection and prevention, allowing timely medical intervention. It enhances healthcare efficiency and supports better patient outcomes. The model can be used by both individuals and healthcare professionals to promote **personalized healthcare**, guiding lifestyle improvements and medical decisions.  

This approach leverages AI to make heart disease prediction more accessible, efficient, and impactful.
